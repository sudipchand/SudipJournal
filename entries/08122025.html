<p>Waking up today was surprisingly hard after the small, unplanned Sunday party we had yesterday. I managed to get out of bed around 9 AM and had breakfast, but when I sat down to work on my HPC assignment, I found it impossible to concentrate. At 11:30am we had the Plasticity lecture but I don't know why I didn't go but I decided to play poker with random people on internet. I felt like a disgrace.</p>
<p>Then I decided to learn some html and css by trying out to make a website for my everyday Journal. Such a badass idea!!!</p>

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>I learned the general structure of an html code for a webpage. Now I know:</p>
<ul>
	<li>head</li>
	<li>body</li>
	<li>nav - navigation buttons</li>
	<li>a href="" - individual buttons for nav</li>
	<li>h1,h2,h3 - headings</li>
	<li>hr- horizontal rule</li>
	<li>p - paragraph</li>
	<li>ul- unordered list</li>
	<li>ol- ordered list</li>
	<li>li - list items</li>
</ul>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>CSS is also a thing I must learn for a webpage. So till now I know these:
<ul>
	<li>css can reset browser defaults, margin=0</li>
	<li>
</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
