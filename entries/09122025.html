<p>My day started good, same time as yesterday around 9am. However today I tried to be productive from the moment I woke up. So immidiately after waking up I decided to start working on the HPC assignment, even before fruhstuck. I finished the assignment around 1pm but still had to make the jobscript for the PBS. Then in the afternoon I had 2 lectures to attend.<br>
In the evening there was a supposed christmas party in our faculty but when we went there it was nothing special. So with some friends I decided to play some poker.<br>
Not particularly a very exciting day!!!</p>
<p> Today I realised somethings about me. I speak a lot of nonsense. In the class when I wanted to ask if the thermostat satisfied 2nd law of thermodynamics, I felt lost in explaining things. I need to work on these. The 2nd thing is that I speak a lot of things before giving it a proper thing. I feel this is because I am losing my concentration ability. At some point in the fracture mechanics lecture I was embarrassed.<br>
<p>From tomorrow I will do 15mins meditation every day after waking up, the 1st thing in the morning.<br>
And I will find a way to present my ideas in a better way and speak better.<br>
I need it definitely!!!</p>
